# @hidden-devs/discord-prompts.js

When writing HiddenBot for [Hidden Devs](https://discord.gg/hd), we found many different areas that needed a prompt like system to handle some of the complex command flows that we used. Internally we have used a system like the one provided in this package in order to create complex commands with multiple states and simplify our code. We have decided to open source this package and let the community get its hands on this package in order to help other communities / developers create discord bots with complex prompt functionality.
